  <description brief="Dish states generated from a receiver node are sent here for spike and burst detection. ">

burst_calc is a ROS package for detecting bursts of spiking activity in a neural 
network. A center of activity trajectory (CAT) is calculated for each burst which 
is then forwarded to a dish teleop node to facilitate ARM movement. The package 
consists of a burst creator node, a CAT creator node, and several helper classes. 
This package relies on the other packages in the arm_project stack to perform 
properly.
