  <description brief="This package provides a visual representation of dish states.">

dish_viz is a ROS package for visualizing the activity of a neural network. 
Spikes and centers of activity are plotted in sync with the movement of the ARM, 
allowing for a visual representation of what is causing the movement. The 
package consists of a single node, and relies on the other packages in the 
arm_project stack to perform properly.
