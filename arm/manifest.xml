  <description brief="The arm package controls the ARM and creates movement commands.">

arm is a ROS package for controlling a Manus ARM. The package consists of one 
control node and two teleop nodes. You must have a Manus ARM properly connected 
and configured in order for this package to be of any use. You must have both a 
teleop node and the control node running in order to move the ARM. There is a 
node for keyboard teleop and a node for neuron dish activity teleop.
