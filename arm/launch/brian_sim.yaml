    # Whether or not to record voltage distributions
do_volt_distr: Yes

    # Whether or not to run the burst calculation chain
do_burst_calc: Yes

    # ARM speed. Range from 0 (slowest) to 4 (fastest)
arm_speed: 2

    # Maximum range that the ARM can safely move on the X/Y plane from the start 
    # position in any direction. Should be 20,000 unless the start position is
    # altered. Units are 0.022mm
arm_safe_range: 20000.0

    # Maximum range that the CA will move from the midpoint (4.5, 4.5) of an X/Y 
    # grid. TODO: Make this a self-correcting value rather than a parameter
max_range_from_midpoint: 1.5

    # Playback speed in Hz. A value over 200 may cause segfaults in arm_control
