################################################################################

    # ARM speed. Range from 0 (slowest) to 4 (fastest)
arm_speed: 2

    # Maximum range that the ARM can safely move on the X/Y plane from the start 
    # position in any direction. Should be 20000 unless the start position is
    # altered. Units are 0.022mm
arm_safe_range: 20000.0

    # Maximum range that the CA will move from the midpoint (4.5, 4.5) of an X/Y 
    # grid. TODO: Make this a self-correcting value rather than a parameter
max_range_from_midpoint: 1.5

    # Playback speed in Hz. A value over 200 may cause errors
loop_rate: 200

    # Number of dishes to use to get spike threshold and baseline values
buffer_size: 1000

    # Multiplier of the standard deviation when determining spike threshold
stdev_mult: 2.0

    # Maximum number of dishes to evaluate for a single burst
burst_window: 200

    # Whether or not to truncate volts when recording to a distribution. 1 for 
    # yes (Brian simulation) or 0 for no (real data)
do_truncate_volts: 1
