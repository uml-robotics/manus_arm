  <description brief="A ROS implementation of Manus ARM control via spiking neural networks.">
  
The ROS stack manus_arm allows a Manus ARM to be controlled by activity from a
spiking neural network. Dish simulation and pre-recorded playback is currently
supported, with a live link connection planned.

If you are only interested in code to control the Manus ARM, that can be found
in the "arm" package.
